## Introduction

Project My Website is the initial implementation of my own website which contains information about me that possible recruiters might be interested in.

As of this moment, the Home page and the Portfolio page are implemented with proper information about my work. The about page is currently using Lorem Ipsum for placeholder descriptions about
my about page activities. Click the corresponding picture on the Portfolio page to open a link to the corresponding project. The 3 icons on the bottom(Youtube, LinkedIn, GitHub) link directly to each 
of my corresponding website account pages. The pictures used one each page are located in a corresponding folder with the name of the page that is using them. For example,
the 3 pictures used in the about page are located in the about_files folder. A console log "Hello World" javascript routine is present in every webpage.

My goal is to create a finish product that I feel comfortable using in the interview process. The most important goal while implementing this website is to learn and gain 
confidence when coding in Html,CSS, and Javascript.


## Requirements

Imports CSS family and display from a imported url link that is used in that CSS file. No steps are needed for this. 
This project requires no additional modules. 


## Installation 

Make sure to have the correct about_files, index_files, and portfolio_files folders with their corresponding pictures in them. 
They should be located in the same folder as the html and css files.
