          <h2>Store Inventory Interface</h2>

            <p>
              Provides a interface for the user to add, edit, update, and delete products in the store.
              A list of the available products is always displayed with product information. The list of
              products is interactable, allowing for editing and deleting based on which product is clicked
              on. The list of products is persistent and is always up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              The display interface was implemented used windows forms. The backend uses Microsoft SQL Server 
              to handle the persistent product data. The implementation that connects the windows form to the 
              backend includes thorough exception handling. User input is validated in real time and will display
              a helpful warning error next to the corresponding input box. This was my final project for my C# course.

          <h2>Haunted House Story Game</h2>

            <p>
              You wake up in a dark room with no memory of how you got there. As you try to figure out what
              is happening to you, you hear strange noises emanating from the walls in front of you.
              Eventually you realize that you must pick between two doors that most likely lead to the ungodly
              sounds you are hearing. Which direction will you choose to go?
            </p>
            <p>
              Each room you enter has a unique scary encounter. The player can enter another room by moving east, 
              west, north, and south. The game includes rare random events that may occur when moving to another
              room. Invalid moves by the player prompts the game to provide a list of valid moves. This was my first C# Project.
